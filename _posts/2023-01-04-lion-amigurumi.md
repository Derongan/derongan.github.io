This is a cute lion I designed for my girlfriend's baby nephew. I had already made him an elephant using Auburn Elephant's [wonderful pattern](https://auburnelephant.com/home/elephant-plush/) as well as a freehanded rhino based on the aformentioned pattern and wanted to make him a lion to go alongside them. Most lion patterns I found leaned more teddy bear, and I wanted to make one that was at home with the somewhat more realistic elephant, so I created this pattern.

If you decide to make this pattern, I would love it if you could share it on instagram and tag/mention me! My username is [@derongan](https://instagram.com/derongan).

Please do not sell or redistribute this pattern. Feel free to make for personal use or to sell, but please link back to this site if you do the latter.

## Supplies
* Yellow yarn (Bernat Baby Blanket in Buttercup)
* Brown yarn (Bernat Baby Blanket in Baby Sand)
* 7.0mm Crochet Hook
* Embroidery floss (Black)

I used size 6 super bulky chenille yarn, but you can use whatever. With this yarn and a 7.0mm hook the lion is around 15â€³ tall.
