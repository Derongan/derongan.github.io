This pattern is intended to be used to make earings. I originally made it while making my mom a gift. It should work just as well as a stand alone plush if you want!

If you decide to make this pattern, I would love it if you could share it on instagram and tag/mention me! My username is [@derongan](https://instagram.com/derongan).

Please do not sell or redistribute this pattern. Feel free to make for personal use or to sell, but please link back to this site if you do the latter.

## Supplies
* Brown crochet thread (Aunt Lydia’s Classic Brown)
* Green crochet thread (Aunt Lydia’s Classic Myrtle Green)

I used brown for the shell, green for the undershell, and dark green for the body.
